#   PowerShell_LabCode
#------------------------

# This is an assortment of code I use to quickly provision a server lab environment on my laptop
# running Hyper-V. This allows for quick, flexible installations of Windows 2008 R2, Windows 2012 R2,
# Windows 2016 Preview, and CentOS. Prerequisites include ISOs for each operating system's install media
# and virtual floppy disks containing answer files (if an unattended installation is desired.)
#
# This code is shared here strictly as-is. It's unoptimized, unfinished, and tailored specifically
# to my working environment. Please feel free to use it as a reference for developing your own lab
# code that best fits your needs.
